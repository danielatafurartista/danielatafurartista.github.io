  "about_me_section": "My artistic research revolves around the body as a territory of experience and transformation, exploring its material, symbolic, and social boundaries. Works such as Muerde si tienes que Morder, Hartazgo, and Cenicera unfold performative actions that expose the tension between the intimate and the collective, while Cuerpo invadido and Punto a Punto expand this inquiry into installation and the relationship between space, object, and gesture. Together, these works aim to open questions about vulnerability, resistance, and the ways in which art activates processes of meaning through the body.",
